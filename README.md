# Incident Reporting System (C# MVC)
### Overview
This is a simple incident report system - similar to another on my GitHub - built using ASP.NET Core MVC to highlight the foundational skills of the technology. This project demonstrates the use of authentication, role-based authorisation and session management.

### Features
- User Registration, Login and Authentication
- Incident Reporting

 #### Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server (setup within AWS)
- Bootstrap for styling
- BCrypt for password hashing


### Future Work
- Role-based authorisation: only admin users can view incidents
- Audit logging: important actions are logged for auditing practices
- Error handling: implement an overarching error handling system to catch and log errors
- Advanced search functions: search incidents by type/keyword
